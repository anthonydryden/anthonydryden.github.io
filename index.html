<h1>WELCOME</h1>

I am an amateur developer who has recently graduated from the Western Sydney University with a Bachelor's Degree in Information and Communication Technology.<br/> 
I have a passion for game development, and in my spare time I have been using the Unity engine to create projects, using the C# language. I have intermediate experience in Java, HTML and JavaScript, as well as amateur knowledge of C languages. <br/>
I have a passion for all things technology, and I am hoping to move on from my current position as a retail salesperson and properly use my degree to persue a career in development. I believe that creating this website allows me to convey my experience and aptitude in a more presentable format and allows people to have an interactive way to know more about me.
