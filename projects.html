					<h3>GAME: <a href="web_builds/Space_Shooter/index.html">Space Shooter</a></h3>
					<p>The first game I made during my time at university. It was my first experience with the Unity engine. I learned how to develop in both Java and C# as the engine supports both languages.</p>

				<div class="box"> <span class="icon icon-play"></span>
					<h3>GAME: <a href="web_builds/Planet_Zombalien/index.html">Planet Zombalien</a></h3>
					<p>The second game I created during my time at university, which was a more independent project. This game allowed me to learn on my own how to create and import art assets, user interface elements, enemy AI and many more things. I would like to fix some bugs for quality assurance and add animations, but I will keep it in this state as it was a learning experience. </p>

					<h3>SCRIPT: <a href="randomlevelgeneration.html">Random Level Generation</a></h3>
					<p>A random level generation script I created in my spare time while working at JB Hi-Fi. I learned more in-depth about arrays and loops, especially how to not create infinite loops. This script was a prototype that was made in Java. I would like to return to this script to add extra comments and complete it, but it has been brought over to a Unity engine game I am currently working on.</p>

					<h3>UNIVERSITY: 360 Timelapse</h3>
					<p>Part of a Professional Experience course in University, I created a web portal that controlled a Ricoh Theta 360 degree camera, which had a backend NodeJS application to capture 360 degree photos at set intervals, and stitch them together to create a 360 timelapse video.</p>
